I am Woojeong Lee. I am currently working as a Post-Master Researcher at the Yonsei Psychological Science Innovation Institute in South Korea. I received my B.S. in Food and Nutrition (2023) and my M.S. in Cognitive Science (2025) from Yonsei University. My research interests are in understanding how internal states shape human cognitive processes and interactions with the external environment, and how these processes are represented in the brain.
