I am Woojeong Lee, a research associate at Yonsei University.
My research focuses on the mechanisms that underlie memory and social cognition, integrating behavioral experiments, neurocognitive methods, and computational modeling. Specifically, I investigate how high-level social and semantic contexts interact with perception and memory, and how these processes are instantiated in the brain.
