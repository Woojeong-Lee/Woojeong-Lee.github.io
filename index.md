I am Woojeong Lee, a research associate at Yonsei University, South Korea.
<br> I am interested in the mechanisms underlying memory and social cognition. Specifically, I seek to understand how high-level contexts—such as social and semantic—interact with perception and memory, and how these processes are implemented in the brain.
